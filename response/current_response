To find Peter's age, we can use the information from the "age_report.txt" document:

1. From Line 1 of "age_report.txt":
   - Anna is 5 years older than Peter.

2. From Line 3 of the same "age_report.txt" document:
   - Anna is 29 years old.

We can set up the equation:
Anna's age (A) = Peter's age (P) + 5
Since Anna's age (A) is 29, we can substitute it into the equation:
29 = P + 5

Now, solving for Peter's age (P):
P = 29 - 5
P = 24

So, based on the information provided, Peter is 24 years old.
