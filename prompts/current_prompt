Summarize the following text with respect to the question How old is Peter?: 
Based on the provided findings from different documents, here is the summary of relevant information to answer the question "How old is Peter?":

1. From the "age_report.txt" document:
   - Line 1: "Anna is 5 years older than Peter."

2. From the same "age_report.txt" document:
   - Line 3: "Anna is 29."

Based on this information, we can calculate Peter's age:
Let's denote Peter's age as "P" and Anna's age as "A."

From Line 1, we know that:
A = P + 5

From Line 3, we know that Anna's age (A) is 29:
A = 29

Now, we can substitute the value of A from Line 3 into the equation from Line 1:
29 = P + 5

Solving for P:
P = 29 - 5
P = 24

So, based on the provided information, Peter is 24 years old.
